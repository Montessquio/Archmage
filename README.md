# Archmage

Archmage is a Discord bot designed to assist D&D groups in managing their games.

## Features

Archmage provides the following features:

- Role or Whitelist-based Inventory management. Allow your players to add and remove items and gold from a shared party pool, without the need for DM intervention. Each transaction is logged, so you can see who used what, when.

- Roll or Whitelist-based Quest management. Allow players to track quests and their completion status, as well as vote on which quest they want to do most.

- Flexible dice parsing. Archmage will roll *all* your dice for you, and do it your way with its flexible roll interpreter.

- Command-based Talking Stick. When the voice channel becomes too hectic, and people are shouting all over each other, the DM may enable *stick mode*, which restricts speaking permissions only to the one who holds the talking stick, or has the `Mute Members` permission.

- House Rules Lookup. One command to explain any house rules your particular game has.
